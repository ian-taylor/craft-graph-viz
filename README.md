# craft-graph-viz

A graph visualization using the asic-flow.json flow as input and http://js.cytoscape.org/ for the rendering.

Kept it simple for now in plain Javascript, although cytoscape is installed using node and there is a
EmberJS package for cytoscape that we can use in the Ember craft app.
